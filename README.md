# Flutter State Managers

A Flutter mobile application created using different state managers, such as Bloc, GetX, Provider, Cubit, and Singleton.

The code corresponding to each state manager can be found in the corresponding branch. For example, code corresponding to Bloc is in the branch 'bloc'. The main branch contains the shell of the application that has different implementations in the other branches.
